Folder contains the following:

# Files that take UNPD data files and extract the relevant country date on fertility and mortality:
read_UNPD_fertility_data.py
read_UNPD_mortality_data.py

- generate ZimbabweFertility_WPP2017.csv (which is the file param_fertility.txt), ZimbabweMortalityMen_WPP2017.csv and ZimbabweMortalityWomen_WPP2017.csv


EstimatingRatesFromUNPDv2.Rnw then takes the mortality files generated by read_UNPD_mortality_data.py and generates
a file Zimbabwe_mortalityByAgeCoefficients.txt. This is the file param_mortality.py

Folder also contains the relevant UNPD WPP 2017 data files (downloaded 28 June 2019).
