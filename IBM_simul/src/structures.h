/* Keeps track of whose birthday occurs each timestep.
   Allows us to trigger age-related events (here it would be the transition of barrier states).
   Question - what should we choose as the array size?
   Suppose we look at one specific timestep. The probability that any one person has a birthday on that timestep is (1/N_TIME_STEP_PER_YEAR), so we can treat it as binomial. The probability that the number of people with birthday on that timestep is below some limit M is then the cumulative distribution of the binomial. 
   R has a function pbinom() that does cumulativer binomial probability. 
   1-pbinom(1300,50000,1/48) = 2.88658e-15
   So the probability of getting more than 1300 people with the same birthday timestep in a population of 50,000 is around 3*10^-15. 
   Note that we are working with MAX_POP_SIZE so this is big.
   I'm guessing that M=2*MAX_POP_SIZE/N_TIME_STEP_PER_YEAR would have a tiny probability of ever being exceeded (note that roughly 0.5*MAX_POP_SIZE in each gender).
