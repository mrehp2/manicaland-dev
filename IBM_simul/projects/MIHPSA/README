# Post-calibration on HPC:

When running on the HPC, each RESULTS$i directory should have its own Calibration_MIHPSA.csv file. This is generated from the MIHPSA_output_CL05_Zim_patch0_Rand10_RunR.csv files (pulls the numbers for certain outputs at specified times, and calculates a likelihood compared to MIHPSA data (DHS HIV prevalence and programme data on ART, VMMC etc).


Then use the code find_best_mihpsa_plots.py to generate goodfits_mihpsa.txt.
 - You need to modify the line for results_rootdir

pull_parameters_MIHPSA2.py uses goodfits_mihpsa.txt and pulls the corresponding parameters into IMPACT_MIHPSAFIT/params (generating the directories automatically).

Copy file run_baseline.sh, and put popart-simul.exe in the IMPACT_MIHPSAFIT directory, then:
 - need to edit params/param_processed_patch0_times.csv to make sure end time is at least *2042* (currently 2030 for calibration) - needs to be 2042 as we need output to 2041.5.
 - run

# Generating outputs for MIHPSA project:

get_mihpsa_project_outputs.py
 - this needs to be in the IMPACT_MIHPSAFITS directory as it looks for subdirectory params/Output/.
 Generates file MIHPSA_project_outputs_stage1.csv
  - if validate=1 (line 497) then generates files checks/N_circ.csv, Incidence_15_49.csv and Prop_tests_pos_15plus.csv, which I used to check by hand that things work.
