CHiPs-related parameters
====================


Timing of CHiPs rounds  
--------------------------------

The CHiPs schedule for South Africa that we're using still doesn't give very convincing results as the cascade for the awareness of status is not fitting to the data very well.  This is likely cause we're reducing the proportion of people visited by CHiPs in rounds 2 and 1 (in South Africa) cause we don't have data for this.  Email from Sian (*18 Oct 2017*) has the dates of CHiPs rounds for Zambia and South Africa.  

| Round | Country | Start | End |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Zambia | Nov 2013 | 30 June 2015 |
| 2 | Zambia | 1 June 2015 | 23 Oct 2016 |
| 3 | Zambia | 1 Sept 2016 | 30 Sept 2017 |
| 4 | Zambia | 1 Oct 2017 | 31 Dec 2017 |
| 1 | South Africa | 1 Jan 2014 | 30 Apr 2015 |
| 2 | South Africa | 1 June 2015 | 5 Aug 2016 |
| 3 | South Africa | 1 Sept 2016 | 30 Sept 2017 |
| 4 | South Africa | 1 Oct 2017 | 31 Dec 2017 | 

Notes

* Round 2 Zambia overlaps with end R1 and start R3
* Round 4 South Africa is really just a mop-up; from a data perspective we will update the R3 dataset, not have a separate file.
