Zambia DHS 2013 table 13.12.1 and 13.12.2 (p217) has % ever tested but did not receive results to be 1.9% (women) 4.1% (men) so 3% average.

Aim to be consistent with Page 5, http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20131219_AccessARTAfricaStatusReportProgresstowards2015Targets_en_0.pdf gives 24% VS and 32% on ART (denom=all HIV+ in both cases). Accessed 12 may 2015. Barnabas Lancet HIV 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25601912) reports 77% of participants on ART are VS by 12 months. Vinikoor has 13% poor adherence and 26% suboptimal by 12 months. Upper limit: Maskew 2012. Helen thinks 80% is reasonable (e-mail 27 Sept 2016).
p_stays_virally_suppressed 0.6 // FIXED When become VS there are 3 possible events - remains VS for life, becomes VU or LFUP (p=1-stays_virally_suppressed-stops_virally_suppressed). Vinikoor (see PopART IBM ART states.docx) suggests around 30% drop our between 1-8 years after starting ART based on KM curve fig 3,and 13% have low adherence (<80%), so take 1 - (0.3+0.13) = 0.57
